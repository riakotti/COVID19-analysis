# COVID19-analysis

Initially, I was curious to perfom a COVID-19 analysis globally. I created an interactive map of COVID-19 and I found which are the top and bottom 10 countries according to different criteria (e.g. comulative cases per population in each country).

Afterwards, I focused on COVID-19 in 6 countries: United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Greece and Bulgaria. I compared the cases and deaths across time and cumulative cases on the  last date of the study.[Â¶](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?commit=444bb7cfd1368f6556f9ec74e1516eed4885394c&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f7269616b6f7474692f434f56494431392d616e616c797369732f343434626237636664313336386636353536663965633734653135313665656434383835333934632f434f56494431392e6970796e62&nwo=riakotti%2FCOVID19-analysis&path=COVID19.ipynb&repository_id=267426262&repository_type=Repository#Analysis-of-COVID-19-in-UK,-GER,-FR,-IT,-GR-and-BG-using-API.-Compare-the-cases-and-deaths-across-time-and-cumulative-cases-on-the-last-date-of-the-study.)
