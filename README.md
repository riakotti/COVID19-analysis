# COVID19-analysis

Initially, I was curious to perfom a COVID-19 analysis globally. I created an interactive map of COVID-19 and I found which are the top and bottom 10 countries according to different criteria (e.g. comulative cases per population in each country).

Afterwards, I focused on COVID-19 in 6 countries: United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Greece and Bulgaria. I compared the cases and deaths across time and cumulative cases on the  last date of the study.

Data requested using the [COVID-19 API](https://api.statworx.com/covid).
